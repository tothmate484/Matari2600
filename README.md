# Matari2600

Free and open-source Atari 2600 (a.k.a Atari VCS) emulator mostly for educational pouposes. It's written in pure C++, using the open-soruce multiplatform and user-friendly OpenGL-based Raylib graphical library. It's target platform is Raspberry Pi, but as I don't use any platform dependent functionality it should run on every hardware that has a proper C++ compiler and is able to use Raylib.

Project stand: Complete MOS 6502 ALU, CU work in progress

Project complexity so far: around 600 LOC

Technical: I use Windows 10, VS Code and and gcc (g++, MinGW) during developent. When I reach the testing phase I will share a build file that should compile it platform independently.
